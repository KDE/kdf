<h2>
<a NAME="KwikDisk"></a><font size=+1>KwikDisk</font></h2>
KwikDisk docks itself into the Panel and when you click on it, it shows
you all mountpoints, icons and the free disk space (if the device is mounted).
<br>When you select a mountpoint it tries to mount this as described in
the <a href="#(U)Mount Commands">(U)Mount Commands</a> section.
<br>You may also start a <a href="#KdiskFree">KDiskFree</a> from the menu
there.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="KdiskFree"></a><font size=+1>KdiskFree</font></h2>
KDiskFree provides you a graphical overview on your block devices (disks,
partitions, floppy-drive...) and their usage.
<br>It reads the file /etc/fstab to get information about possibly mounted
devices and then periodically calls the df-command to look at actually
mounted devices.
<br>Unmounted devices are shown in lightgray.
<p>You may invoke KDiskFree ("kcmdf") from your KControlCenter under Information/Block
Devices
<br>or directly by typing "kdf".
<br>"kdf" is more light-weighted in the screen-size used, so if you want
to always have a KDiskFree open
<br>(as I do) try "kdf" instead of "kcmdf".
<br>&nbsp;
<p>KDiskFree was written 1998 by Michael Kropfberger (<a href="mailto:michael.kropfberger@gmx.net">michael.kropfberger@gmx.net</a>)

<h3>
<a NAME="Overview"></a>Overview:</h3>
There are following columns which are shown in <a href="#KdiskFree">KDiskFree</a>:
<ul>
<li>
<b><font size=+1>Icon</font></b></li>

<br>shows icon for the actual device/mountpoint combination
<li>
<b><font size=+1>Device</font></b></li>

<br>shows the filename of the listed device
<li>
<b><font size=+1>Type</font></b></li>

<br>shows the filesystem-type of the listed device (e.g. ext2, msdos, vfat,
minix...)
<li>
<b><font size=+1>Size</font></b></li>

<br>shows the maximum size of the device
<li>
<b><font size=+1>MountPoint</font></b></li>

<br>shows you, where the device is mounted to
<li>
<b><font size=+1>Free</font></b></li>

<br>shows you, how many Bytes (rounded to Gigabytes, Megabytes, Kilobytes
for convenience) are really available
<li>
<b><font size=+1>Full%</font></b></li>

<br>inicates the percentage of fullness; if this exceeds 95%, the whole
device entry is printed out in <b><i><font color="#FF0000">red</font></i></b>&nbsp;
and a warning
<br>message pops up on the active desktop.
<li>
<b><font size=+1>UsageBar</font></b></li>

<br>shows you the space-usage in a graphical way (<b><i><font color="#3333FF">blue</font></i></b>
= full, <font color="#000000"><b><i>white</i></b> </font>= available)</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Features"></a>Features:</h3>
there are also many usable features included:
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
left-, double-, mid- or right-click on the devicename of the device of
your interest to mount/unmount it immediately. This invokes the given mountscript
for the device/mountpoint or calls the default "mount" command (see the
<a href="#(U)Mount Commands">(U)Mount Commands</a>).</li>

<li>
left-, double-, mid- or right-click on the MountPoint of the device of
your interest to open a FileManager (e.g. kfm) with the mountpoint as starting
directory</li>

<li>
you may also disable some of the columns you don't want to see (look at
<a href="#General Settings:">General
Settings </a>for further information)</li>

<li>
click on the Headers of the TabList to sort the devices accordingly</li>
</ul>

<h3>

<hr WIDTH="100%"></h3>

<h3>
<a NAME="General Settings:"></a>General Settings:</h3>
If you click on the <i>Settings</i>-Button you enroll a more-featured settings-window.
<br>primarily you may want to change the update-frequency of KDiskFree.
<br>Just use the scrollBar to select the appropriate frequency. If you
want to DISABLE the auto-update-feature, you only have to select 0 as your
update-frequency.
<br>To force an update, just press the Apply-Button.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>There you can enable/disable the shown columns of your device-Overview.
<br>If you don't want to see the Filesystem-Type (which maybe is not of
<i>that</i>
interest to you, because it doesn't change all 5 seconds) you may just
click on the <i>Type</i>-Header in your settings-window, so the checked-icon
under <i>Type </i>changes to a crossed-out-icon. To enable it, just press
the <i>Type</i>-Header again and the crossed-out-icon becomes a checked-icon.
<br>For convenience, you may also double-, mid- or right-click on the icons
to get the same effect.
<p>There is also a LineEdit to enter the preferred FileManager used when
you click on the mountpoint of a device.
<br>The <i>%m</i> will be substituted with the actual mountpoint.
<p>To reset all to the default values, just click on the <i>Defaults</i>-Button
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
<a NAME="(U)Mount Commands"></a>(U)Mount Commands</h3>
In this Tab you can edit mount commands for every device/mountpoint pair.
<br>This is eg. useful for zip-drives which need a root-called <tt>insmod
ppa</tt> before mounting is possible.
<br>You could write a little script like this to do that:
<br><tt>#!/bin/bash</tt>
<br><tt>kdesu -c insmod ppa</tt>
<br><tt>mount /zip</tt><tt></tt>
<p>and store it in <tt>/usr/local/bin/mount_zip</tt>. Now you can use this
script when you click on the device <tt>/zip</tt>.
<br>Possible parameters are:
<br>&nbsp;
<table BORDER COLS=2 WIDTH="30%" NOSAVE >
<tr NOSAVE>
<td WIDTH="10%" NOSAVE>%d</td>

<td>DeviceName</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>%m</td>

<td>MountPoint</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>%t</td>

<td>FilesystemType</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>%o</td>

<td>MountOptions</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>If no mount command is given, a default <tt>"mount %d"</tt> is used
instead.
<br>If you are root the default command is <tt>"mount -t%t %d %m -o %o"</tt>.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h3>
<a NAME="Icons"></a>Icons</h3>
If the user doesn't set a specific Icon in the <a href="#(U)Mount Commands">(U)Mount
Commands</a> settings dialog, a special magic is tried.
<br>So a device /dev/fd0 or mountpoint /floppy gets a floppy icon assigned.
Also NFS&nbsp;mounts are recognized and a special icon is shown.
<br>Every device/mountpoint can be mounted (green button in the buttom
right)&nbsp;and if it is only (u)mountable by root, the icon gets a red
frame around it.
<br>If the user gives his own icon, there are a few important things to
keep in mind:
<br>all filenames for icons have to look like this:<tt>&nbsp;myicon_mount.xpm</tt>
and <tt>myicon_unmount.xpm</tt> because only <tt>myicon</tt> is stored
and the rest is appended.
<br>The files should be in the mini-icon directory (this is <tt>$KDEDIR/share/icons/mini</tt>
or <tt>$HOME/.kde/share/icons/mini</tt>).
