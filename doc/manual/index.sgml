      <HEADING>KwikDisk</HEADING>
      <P>KwikDisk docks itself into the Panel and when you click on it, it shows you all mountpoints, icons and the free disk space (if the device is mounted).  When you select a mountpoint it tries to mount this as described in section <REF ID="(U)Mount Commands" NAME="(U)Mount Commands">.  You may also start a <REF ID="KdiskFree" NAME="KDiskFree"> from the menu there.</P>
    </SECT>
    <SECT>
      <HEADING>KdiskFree<LABEL ID="KdiskFree"></HEADING>
      <P>KDiskFree provides you a graphical overview on your block devices (disks, partitions, floppy-drive...) and their usage.  It reads the file /etc/fstab to get information about possibly mounted devices and then periodically calls the df-command to look at actually mounted devices.  Unmounted devices are shown in lightgray.</P>
      <p>You may invoke KDiskFree ("kcmdf") from your KControlCenter under Information/Block Devices or directly by typing "kdf".  "kdf" is more light-weighted in the screen-size used, so if you want to always have a KDiskFree open (as I do) try "kdf" instead of "kcmdf".</P>
      <p>KDiskFree was written 1998 by <HTMLURL URL="mailto:michael.kropfberger@gmx.net" NAME="Michael Kropfberger"> and underlies the terms of GPL.</P>
      <SECT1>
	<HEADING>Overview</HEADING>
	<P>There are following columns which are shown in <REF ID="KdiskFree" NAME="KDiskfree">:
	  <DESCRIP>
	    <TAG>Icon</TAG>
	    <P>shows icon for the actual device/mountpoint combination</P>
	    <TAG>Device</TAG>
	    <P>shows the filename of the listed device</P>
	    <TAG>Type</TAG>
	    <P>shows the filesystem-type of the listed device (e.g. ext2, msdos, vfat, minix...)</P>
	    <TAG>Size</TAG>	  
	    <P>shows the maximum size of the device</P>
	    <TAG>MountPoint</TAG>
	    <P>shows you, where the device is mounted to</P>
	    <TAG>Free</TAG>
	    <P>shows you, how many Bytes (rounded to Gigabytes, Megabytes, Kilobytes for convenience) are really available</P>
	    <TAG>Full %</TAG>
	    <P>indicates the percentage of fullness; if this exceeds 95%, the whole device entry is printed out in <BF><IT>red</IT></BF> and a warning message pops up on the active desktop.</P>
	    <TAG>UsageBar</TAG>
	    <P>shows you the space-usage in a graphical way (<BF><IT>blue</IT></BF> = full, <BF><IT>white</IT></BF>= available)</P>
	  </DESCRIP></P>
      </SECT1>
      <SECT1>
	<HEADING>Features</HEADING>
	<P>There are also many usable features included:
	  <ITEMIZE>
	    <ITEM>left-, double-, mid- or right-click on the devicename of the device of your interest to mount/unmount it immediately. This invokes the given mountscript for the device/mountpoint or calls the default "mount" command (see <REF ID="(U)Mount Commands" NAME="(U)Mount Commands">).</ITEM>
	    <ITEM>left-, double-, mid- or right-click on the MountPoint of the device of your interest to open a FileManager (e.g. kfm) with the mountpoint as starting directory</ITEM>
	    <ITEM>you may also disable some of the columns you don't want to see (look at <REF ID="General Settings" NAME="General Settings"> for further information)</ITEM>
	    <ITEM>click on the Headers of the TabList to sort the devices accordingly</ITEM>
	  </ITEMIZE></P>
      </SECT1>
      <SECT1>
	<HEADING>General Settings<LABEL ID="General Settings"></HEADING>
      <P>If you click on the <IT>Settings</IT>-Button you enroll a more-featured settings-window.  Primarily you may want to change the update-frequency of KDiskFree.  Just use the scrollBar to select the appropriate frequency.  If you want to DISABLE the auto-update-feature, you only have to select 0 as your update-frequency.  To force an update, just press the Apply-Button.</P>
      <p>There you can enable/disable the shown columns of your device-Overview.  If you don't want to see the Filesystem-Type (which maybe is not of <IT>that</IT> interest to you, because it doesn't change every five seconds) you may just click on the <IT>Type</IT>-Header in your settings-window, so the checked-icon under <IT>Type </IT>changes to a crossed-out-icon. To enable it, just press the <IT>Type</IT>-Header again and the crossed-out-icon becomes a checked-icon.  For convenience, you may also double-, mid- or right-click on the icons to get the same effect.</P>
	<p>There is also a LineEdit to enter the preferred FileManager used when you click on the mountpoint of a device.  The <IT>%m</IT> will be substituted with the actual mountpoint.</P>
	<p>To reset all to the default values, just click on the <IT>Defaults</IT>-Button</P>
      </SECT1>
      <SECT1>
	<HEADING>(U)Mount Commands<LABEL ID="(U)Mount Commands"></HEADING>
	<P>In this Tab you can edit mount commands for every device/mountpoint pair.  This is eg. useful for zip-drives which need a root-called <tt>insmod ppa</tt> before mounting is possible. You could write a little script like this to do that:
	  <CODE>#!/bin/bash
kdesu -c insmod ppa
mount /zip</CODE>
	  and store it in <tt>/usr/local/bin/mount_zip</tt>.  Now you can use this script when you click on the device <tt>/zip</tt>.  Possible parameters are:
	  <TABLE>
	    <TABULAR CA="ll">
	      %d<COLSEP>Device Name<ROWSEP>
	      %m<COLSEP>Mount Point<ROWSEP>
	      %t<COLSEP>Filesystem Type<ROWSEP>
	      %o<COLSEP>Mount Options
	    </TABULAR>
	  </TABLE>
	  If no mount command is given, a default <tt>"mount %d"</tt> is used instead.  If you are root the default command is <tt>"mount -t%t %d %m -o %o"</tt>.</P>
      </SECT1>
      <SECT1>
	<HEADING>Icons</HEADING>
	<P>If the user doesn't set a specific Icon in <REF ID="(U)Mount Commands" NAME="(U)Mount Commands"> settings dialog, a special magic is tried.  So a device /dev/fd0 or mountpoint /floppy gets a floppy icon assigned.  Also NFS mounts are recognized and a special icon is shown.  Every device/mountpoint can be mounted (green button in the buttom right) and if it is only (u)mountable by root, the icon gets a red frame around it.  If the user gives his own icon, there are a few important things to keep in mind: all filenames for icons have to look like this: <tt>myicon_mount.xpm</tt> and <tt>myicon_unmount.xpm</tt> because only <tt>myicon</tt> is stored and the rest is appended.  The files should be in the mini-icon directory (this is <tt>$KDEDIR/share/icons/mini</tt> or <tt>$HOME/.kde/share/icons/mini</tt>).</P>
